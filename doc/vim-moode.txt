INTRODUCTION                                     *vim-moode-introduction*

Adjust the volume on your raspberry pi without leaving your editor.  This plugin
currently supports all available features of moOde audio's limited web api.

COMMANDS                                         *vim-moode-commands*

These commands are supported:
    Moode         Shows status
    MoodeMute     Toggles muting
    MoodePlay     Presses Play
    MoodeStop     Presses Stop
    MoodeUp       Increases Volume
    MoodeDown     Decreases Volume

CONFIGURATION                                    *vim-moode-configuration*

By default, the plugin sends commands to http://localhost/.  The http scheme,
http host, and http port are configurable. The default settings are:

    let g:moode_scheme = 'http'
    let g:moode_host = '127.0.0.1'
    let g:moode_port = 80

You can configure the volume step, which is the number of clicks the MoodeUp
and MoodeDown commands when no argument is present.  By default it is set to:
    let g:moode_volume_step = 5
